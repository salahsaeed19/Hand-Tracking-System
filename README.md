# Hand Tracking and Gesture Recognition using OpenCV and cvzone

This code snippet demonstrates hand tracking and gesture recognition using the OpenCV library and the `HandTrackingModule` from the `cvzone` package. The code captures video from the default camera and detects hands, tracks landmarks on the hands, and recognizes finger gestures.

## Getting Started

Before running the code, you need to install the required libraries. You can install them using the following commands:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install cvzone
